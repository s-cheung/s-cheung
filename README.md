# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sierra!

pronouns: she/her

### Currently I am..
1. Studying Quantitative Methods in Social Science with a focus on Data Science (graduating with a Master's in May 2022)
2. Interested in working with machine learning models (particularly for image recognition or time-series forecasting)
3. Learning about data visualization in R and convolutional neural network architectures in Python using keras
4. Considering jobs for machine learning and data analysis in various industries

### This GitHib repo contains..
1. Grad School classes/projects
2. Some of my own personal projects


### More about me: 
1. I got interested in machine learning and research in social science through my initial passion for cognitive science. This led me to a general curiosity about information and data processing/interpretation (in the brain and by machines), as well as how bias in this process alters our perception and understanding of the world.
2. I have a strong drive to uplift and encourage others, and it has made me a better teammate, mentor, and friend to those around me both personally and professionally. I work best in a team effort that involves transparency, sharing information, and mutual guidance, rather than in a highly competitive environment.
3. I love to learn. While it can be uncomfortable to be in the vulnerable as a 'novice', I think it's often more uncomfortable to be ignorant. The freedom or enjoyment that comes with learning something new drives me to keep seeking out answers to the questions I come across.

If you have any questions about my work or would like to colaborate on a project, feel free to get in contact!
