### About me
1. Currently I am looking for jobs in research and data science, specifically for positions utilizing statistical analysis and machine learning
2. I have experience working in cognitive science research, mostly lab management and project management. I was responsible for training research assistants, and overseeing multiple studies ranging from computer vision and ML to behavioral and perceptual training studies.
3. My long-term goals are to become an expert in data science and research methods, either leading my own research lab or becoming a senior data scientist.

### This GitHib repo contains..
1. Grad School classes/projects
2. My own personal projects


### More about my background: 
1. I got interested in machine learning and research in social science through my initial passion for cognitive science. This led me to a general curiosity about information and data processing/interpretation (in the brain and by machines), as well as how bias in this process alters our perception and understanding of the world.
2. I have a strong drive to uplift and encourage others, and it has made me a better teammate, mentor, and friend to those around me both personally and professionally. I work best in a team effort that involves transparency, sharing information, and mutual guidance, rather than in a highly competitive environment.
3. I love to learn. While it can be uncomfortable to be in the vulnerable as a 'novice', I think it's often more uncomfortable to be ignorant. The freedom or enjoyment that comes with learning something new drives me to keep seeking out answers to the questions I come across.

If you have any questions about my work or would like to colaborate on a project, feel free to get in contact!
